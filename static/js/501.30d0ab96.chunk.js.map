Trust is\r\n            built on integrity. It is our most precious asset as a company as a\r\n            whole. Individually, it is the continual choice to integrate\r\n            honesty, justice, and respect for clients and colleagues alike into\r\n            every action. Doing things with integrity is not optional or\r\n            temporary; because integrity is the basis of successful leadership,\r\n            displaying this value is critical to winning the trust of our\r\n            coworkers, supervisors, clients, and the global business community.\r\n            Living with integrity entails doing what is right even when it is\r\n            difficult or will not be recognized by others. Leading with\r\n            integrity is a need in our lives and at work, and it is based on the\r\n            premise that our actions are open and transparentâ€”we do not lie or\r\n            conceal the reality of events. We appreciate this virtue at Gopalkar\r\n            & Company because a workplace where supervisors and workers carry\r\n            out their duties with integrity is one that is effective, healthy,\r\n            and encourages desired leadership traits in others. We treat\r\n            everyone equally, regardless of their position within our business.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h2 className={classes.header}>Professionalism</h2>\r\n\r\n          <p className={classes.text}>\r\n            Professionalism entails continuously meeting high standards in both\r\n            your job and your behavior. We individually pledge to strive for\r\n            ongoing improvement and professional development. We take pleasure\r\n            in generating high-quality work and providing outstanding service to\r\n            both internal and external clients. We take pleasure in our\r\n            professional look, language, and demeanor. We accept responsibility\r\n            for maintaining a clean and safe work environment. We retain our\r\n            cool in stressful conditions. We respect people, show genuine\r\n            gratitude, and have a beneficial effect on those around us.\r\n            Professionalism is evident throughout Gopalkar & Company's structure\r\n            and traditions, such as our commitment to professional advancement\r\n            through leadership retreats for Program Leads, the Board of\r\n            Directors, and Section Managers.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h2 className={classes.header}>Reliability</h2>\r\n\r\n          <p className={classes.text}>\r\n            People intrinsically respect dependability. Every day, we place a\r\n            high value on things like consistent internet access, mobile phone\r\n            service, aircraft flying off on schedule, our automobiles\r\n            transporting us from point A to point B, and our family, friends,\r\n            and coworkers doing what they say they would do. When these things\r\n            are dependable, they not only provide us with increased efficiency\r\n            and peace of mind, but they also assist us in forging deeper\r\n            connections and delivering better outcomes. We place a high value on\r\n            individuals and firms who can consistently provide good outcomes\r\n            time after time and who can be relied on to keep commitments and\r\n            pledges. Recognizing its relevance and value as leaders is vital to\r\n            our success. A dependable team or organization is actually just a\r\n            collection of dependable individuals. With this in mind, company\r\n            dependability begins with us as leaders and our ability to instill\r\n            it in those we deal with. Understanding how our customers see and\r\n            consider our dependability may have a significant influence on our\r\n            jobs, prospects, and capacity to deliver successfully.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </React.Fragment>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n"],"names":["root","SectionHeight","Padding","paddingTop","paddingBottom","display","justifyContent","alignItems","image","width","height","backgroundImage","Image","backgroundPosition","backgroundSize","backgroundRepeat","container","flexDirection","header","padding","Lib32","letterSpacing","color","text","TextCSS","paddingLeft","useStyles","makeStyles","AboutCSS","classes","Helmet","name","content","className"],"sourceRoot":""}
